# 0. Vision
FOR students trying to register for classes

WHO are unable to find sections relevant to them,

THE Class Registration Assistant is a tool that helps them discover courses which:

i.   satisfy degree requirements,
ii.  are taught by professors that they enjoy,
iii. and are not full.

this is UNLIKE the default class registration tool, which

iv.  *does not* show which classes meet degree requirements, and
v.   *does not* show crowd-sourced professor feedback

# 1. Deliverables
## 1.1 Section View
A webpage that lists all sections meeting a certain criteria. 
Possible features include:

- Sort / Filter by
    - column values
    - degree requirements
    - ratemyprofessors data (stretch&nbsp;goal)

- Highlight sections taught by professors whose you've taken before (stretch&nbsp;goal)
- Automatically choose a Schedule based off of declared Major (stretch&nbsp;goal)

## 1.2. Automated Sign-Up
Backend infrastructure that helps students sign up for class.
This could involve

- Reminders - The system could send emails / text when it's time to register
- Automatic Registration - A student would select their desired classes ahead of time, and the program would use CofC's registration API to sign them up for specific classes (stretch&nbsp;goal)

## 1.3. Detailed Section Information
A webpage that lists information about a particular section. This could include:

- Exhaustive information about a section (eg: a dump of the JSON data)
- A graph showing the history of open seats, to help students anticipate class capacity.

# 2. Potential Integrations
- Use a SQL database to store class info, changes, etc.
- Accept and/or incentivize Ethereum (ETH) Donations/Payment (stretch&nbsp;goal)
